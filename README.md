Learning coding to better myself

Zebulin here. I'm just your typical factory worker. I've been a sim racer for a long time,
and I decided it's time I put my time behind the screen to other uses, better uses, as 
I'm sure most would say. I started dreaming up what I could do to add something special to being an average
Joe that works his *** off to make money to continue the never ending upgrade of game controllers, cpu components,
new games, etc etc.
During that time I started learning how to weld at work, and as my gaming rigs have primarily been made
from wood lying around the house, I started getting particularly interested in our robot welders. 
I've always been into sci-fi, and thinking about moving mechanical parts, a program to control them, the ability
to create a gaming station that I could interact with, being able to program buttons into a console that would interact
with the computer to eliminate the struggle of flipping through menu's with a tiny joystick on the wheel or trying to hit a hotkey 
while behind the wheel or flying a ship with the joys. Seeing the things other people have come up with and the amount
of customization electrical and coding knowledge allowed them to integrate to truely make that build truely one of a kind 
and personalized. 

My life needs to change, and I'm taking steps. Taking trips, bought a dirtbike to travel and see different parts of the country
in a bigger way than just driving somewhere and finding lookout point, trying to get to racetracks more often, etc etc.

I'm 28 years old, I know for sure I'm getting into this game late, but honestly, a new career is second on the menu.
With the knowledge I hope to acquire taking this path, I want to preserve my imagination. I've always had crazy ideas,
some of which would've never worked, but I feel so many good thoughts go to waste, those ideas that come up when you and 
friends are just sitting around shootin' the breeze and some crazy idea comes up, it gets an hour of conversation, then daily
life takes back over when you go seperate ways and it fades away.

I have crazy ideas, and even crazier goals. I'm not that smart on paper, and I know this is going to be insanely hard. 
But I'm tired of letting my ability to get distracted and losing my ambition in a nights sleep keep me from making a real change
in my life. I know my way around a computer, I'm learning circuits from step one using breadboards, and I'm going to try to keep this momentum going.

Any, and absolutely all help is welcome, if its that kind of community. I'm on step 1, if and else statements are making my head explode, and I still have zero understanding of how a code, turns into a program, or a display, or, anything really. I'm that uninformed. Even getting this Repository up correctly took me a bit, and I only got to here because I cant get VS onto my RPi to follow this youtube turtorial. 

If you put your head in your hands instead of laughing, shame on you, laugh. It's always funny to see a toddler trip for the first time, the look of surprise on their face, the 10 seconds it takes for them to realize "hey... wait... NO... THAT HURTS! MOOOOOMM!"

Just remember to always help the toddler back up so he can try again. I am that toddler.

If you made it this far. Thanks, I appreciate that you took the time, and were willing to read another mans rambling. 
Zebulin Out.
